            <h2>Our vision</h2>
            <p> Humans as a species  have treated the earth in a way it is not durable anymore. We want to detach the world from fossil sources and empower people from all environments to get a renewed, sustainable life.

            <h2>Our people</h2>
            <p>Thijs is a 25 year old male. He lives in the struggle between being sustainable and being able to afford these better products every day. Thijs, who grew up in a small town in the Netherlands, believes that our society is too commercial and not informed enough about the options in sustainable products. At this point, Thijs works in his spare time, also to keep the costs as low as possible. Want to help or join the team?<a href="contact.html"> Let us know!</a>
